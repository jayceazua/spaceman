### Description
Spaceman is a guessing game. There is a mystery word which the user tries to guess one letter at a time.

### To start game
``` $ python spaceman.py ```

### Technologies used:
- Python 3.7.0

## Future developments:
- need to have edge cases:
--* limit the amount of turns
--* exit if the user reaches their max turns allowed.
--* allow the user to guess the complete word if given the chance
--* once the user wins or losess allow for the user to reset the game
- nice to have edge cases
--* Edge Case: did the user actually put in one letter and is it a letter or charater
